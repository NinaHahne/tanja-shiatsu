shiatsu: "Shiatsu is energy work in motion — an invitation to slow down, to breathe, and to\u00A0feel."

shiatsu_text: "Through calm, intentional pressure and gentle stretches, the body’s energy flow is encouraged to move and rebalance where it has fallen out of harmony. \nThis form of bodywork supports you in releasing inner tension, sensing new vitality, reconnecting with yourself, and realigning from within. It strengthens your center and nurtures regeneration on every level."
