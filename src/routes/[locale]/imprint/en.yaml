  <h3>Note on the Nature of Shiatsu</h3>
  <p>Shiatsu is a mindful and holistic form of bodywork. It supports people in reconnecting with themselves, finding inner and outer balance, and strengthening their natural life energy.</p>
  <p>Shiatsu does not replace medical or psychotherapeutic treatment. If you experience health concerns, please consult a doctor or licensed healthcare professional you trust.</p>
